		errors: 0, warnings: 0
		Caching library 'worklib' ....... Done
	Elaborating the design hierarchy:
	Top level design units:
		calculator_pkg
		$unit_0x201ca083
		calc_tb_pkg
		calc_tb_top

	Extracting FSMs for coverage:
		worklib.controller
			FSM extracted for state register state
		worklib.sky130_sram_2kbyte_1rw1r_32x512_8
		worklib.full_adder
		worklib.adder32
		worklib.result_buffer
		worklib.top_lvl
		worklib.calc_tb_top
	Total FSMs extracted = 1
	Building instance overlay tables: ..
xmelab: *W,COVFDP: FSM description matching across instance of a module for "COVFDM" warning has been moved from elaboration to simulation dumping. To restore old matching behavior, use "set_backward_compat -COVFDM_during_elab". Also, it is recommended to use set_parameterized_module_coverage CCF command to avoid coverage loss due to FSM description difference across instances of a module.
xmelab: *W,COVFHT: FSM hold transitions (transitions to the current state) are not extracted for any FSM in default mode.
.................. Done
	Enabling instrumentation for coverage types: block expression FSM toggle functional
xmelab: *W,COVDCL: By default expression coverage is scored only for Verilog logical operators (|| and &&) and VHDL logical operators (OR, AND, NOR, and NAND), and is scored only in condition expressions. To score coverage for other operators and for expressions in other statements, use the "set_expr_coverable_operators" and "set_expr_coverable_statements" coverage configuration file commands with suitable options at elaboration.
	Generating native compiled code:
		worklib.calc_tb_top:sv <0x5bcd9bf2>
			streams:  34, words: 69767
xmelab: *W,COVNOEN: By default, toggle coverage is not supported for systemverilog enumerated nets and variables. To enable toggle coverage of these objects, specify the 'set_toggle_scoring -sv_enum' command in the coverage configuration file.
  reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0]    mem [0:RAM_DEPTH-1];
                            |
xmelab: *W,COVMDD (./sym_links/sky130_sram_2kbyte_1rw1r_32x512_8.sv,52|28): Toggle coverage for bit, logic, reg, wire, enum and struct multi-dimensional static arrays and vectors is not supported by default. To enable toggle coverage for enum multi-dimensional static arrays specify 'set_toggle_scoring -sv_enum enable_mda' and for other multi-dimensional static arrays, specify 'set_toggle_scoring -sv_mda [<max_bit_base2_exponent>] [-sv_mda_of_struct]' ccf command in the coverage configuration file.
